### Configurable <a name=configurable></a>

Create chart widgets that can be easily configured by [board](?board=welcome.boards) paramaters. For example, the three widgets below are the same but are configured differently. To learn more, take a look at the [welcome.gitsense-trends](https://github.com/gitsense/devboard/packages/welcome/widgets/gitsense-trends) widget to see how it was programmed and the [welcome.demo](https://github.com/gitsense/devboard/packages/welcome/boards/demo) board to see how it was configured.
