### Static Files

If you need to serve static files with your widget, just place them in the widget's "static" directory. See Widgets dashboard for more information and to test things out, click on the link below to view the hello markdown file for this widget.

[http://localhost:3357/api/v0/widgets/welcome/static-files/static/hello.md](http://localhost:3357/api/v0/widgets/welcome/static-files/static/hello.md)

Note, "welcome" is the widget's package name and "static-files" is the name the widget.
